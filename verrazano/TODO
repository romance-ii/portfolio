- add support for cffi-grovel. it's hopelessly complex to evaluate
  preprocessor constants, so the cffi backend should be extended with
  support to generate cffi-grovel files. see iolib for examples.

- add an ABI abstraction layer to the verrazano-runtime and support
  virtual c++ method calls.






- use contextl layered generic methods to generate the
  output. then the various backends could be simply implemented
  using layers.

  DROPPED: it's not worth it, just added the backend as a dispatch
  parameter and users can subclass the backends for customizations.
